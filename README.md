# Soup-of-Letters

LIVE DEMO: [soup-of-letters.herokuapp.com](https://soup-of-letters.herokuapp.com/)

(Demo is hosted on heroku, so it might take a while to load the site)

It's simple web game made for Script Languages classes during my Erasmus.

Objective of this project was to introduce students to web frontend programming with JavaScript and React framework.
One of requirements was to use plain Javascripts and React (no extra librariers), therefore visual side is not most amusing part of this progect but it does work :)

I belive that most important thing of JavaScript and React i learn was React hooks (useEffect(), setState etc...).
